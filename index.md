My name is Derek Chan and I'm a Computer Engineer currently studying at the University of British Columbia.

I've a tinkerer at heart and love developing projects and working with my hands. My home in Burnaby, British Columbia has been my cozy little workshop all my life.

When I'm not wrangling code on my computer, you can find me exploring, biking, jogging or hiking. I love crawling out of my hole one in a while to be amazed by what the world has out there.

Karate is also a huge part of my life. As an athlete on the Canadian National Team, I've been lucky to have travelled all around the world to train with elite athletes and compete in international tournaments.  

There's so much to do and hardly enough time these days. Take a look at my [blog](/blog) to see my recent projects and musings.
