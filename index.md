My name is Derek Chan and I'm a Computer Engineer currently studying at the University of British Columbia.

I've a tinkerer at heart and love developing projects and working with my hands. My home in Burnaby, British Columbia has been my cozy little workshop all my life.

When I'm not wrangling code on my computer, you can find me exploring, biking, jogging or hiking. I love crawling out of my hole one in a while to be amazed by what the world has out there.

I'm also a karate athlete on the Canadian National Team. Travelling for tournaments has taken me to places all over the world that I never would've visited on my own. 

There's so much to do and hardly enough time these days. Take a look at my blog to see my recent projects and musings.
