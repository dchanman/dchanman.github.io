### Summary ###
Are you looking to have a stuffed animal, but can't believe the exorbiant prices that you have to pay to get one these days? $30+ for a Build-A-Bear? Please.

I decided to try the open-source route for a stuffed animal: the sock monkey. A quick Google search brought me to a ton of usage examples, implementation variations, and a lot of photos of seemingly happy end-users. I settled on using the [sources I found here](www.google.com).

Note that its a monkey, not a bear. Creating a sock bear risks patent infringement.


Here was my final product. And should you decide to also try and make your own, here are the pros and cons I noticed from going through the process:

### Pro: Amortization of Costs ###
I happened to have cotton stuffing lying around in my house, and I also needed some new socks. I bought a set of 5 socks for $12. Critical errors in my Alpha-stage implementation meant that I ended up using 150% more socks than planned (although it could be debated that sock usage could only increase by 100% increments).

I spent a total of $3.60 on new supplies that I didn't already have. If I had to factor in the cotton which I previous had, the total cost would be significantly greater. However, note that the cost of a large amount of cotton would be split between all future sock-animal development.

### Pro: Architectural Modularity ###
The open-source approach ultimately allows flexibility in material selection. Components could be substituted for one another with ease. I noticed one person used the same design to make a [sock sloth]().

I ran into an issue where I couldn't find white felt to make the eye modules. I ended up salvaging some white-colored vinyl material from the bottom of my sock box. The result was nearly identical to the original intended effect.

### Con: Time-Cost ###
I don't know how to use a sewing machine. It took too much time to find and follow walkthroughs on YouTube. Fortunately, the former Chief Fabric-fabrication Officer (my mother) stumbled in on me and was sufficiently baffled at why her 21 year old son was trying to do to take 5 minutes and just sew the damn thing. It's kind of embarassing.

### Con: Cotton Quality ###
I have to concede to Build-A-Bear for this one. Their large-scale cotton stuffing system provides consistent cotton density. The tail in my released product could not hold a light to its enterprise counterpart. I'm hoping my final customer doesn't notice.

### Conclusions ###

All in all, the girlfriend gave generally positive feedback on the end product. I'll leave you with some real quotes from users so that you can decide if the open-source stuffed animal approach is right for you:
