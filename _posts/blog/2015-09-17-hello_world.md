Hello!

Wow I can't believe GitHub Pages makes it so easy to host any website! This is so exciting! Now if only I could think of things to blog about...

In the meantime, here's an obligatory Hello World!

{% highlight c %}

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	fprintf(stdout, "Hello World!\n");
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
